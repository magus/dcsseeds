# item parsing

requires parsing properties from item `name` field
regex approach is probarbly most straight forward
exploration under `Equip` screen may be relevant

## tests

write tests for properties from item by grabbing large list of items as test input
calculate all  uniqu properties, confirm it looks right
should be roughly 100% coverage on possible properties given all items as input
